# C - Doubly Linked Lists

This project focuses on implementing doubly linked lists in C. Learn about the structure of doubly linked lists and how to perform operations such as insertion, deletion, and traversal.

## Description

A **doubly linked list** is a data structure where each node contains a reference to both the next and previous nodes, allowing traversal in both directions. This project will teach you how to manage and manipulate data using this structure.

This version keeps it brief and to the point.



##Objectives

- Understand what a **doubly linked list** is.
- Learn how to use and implement **doubly linked lists** in C.
- Perform operations like **insertion**, **deletion**, and **traversal**.
- Develop the ability to find information independently without too much assistance.
